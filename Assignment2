    <h1>Welcome To My About Page</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Blessing Theresa Ejeromedoghene ID number ALT/SOE/025/4480, and
      I am a proud student of AltSchool Africa, currently enrolled in the School
      of Engineering (S.O.E). I joined AltSchool because I believe in the power
      of technology to transform lives, and I am passionate about building
      meaningful solutions that solve real-world problems. The School of
      Engineering offers me the perfect environment to grow my skills, challenge
      myself, and connect with like-minded innovators. In this assignment, Iâ€™ve
      used various media elements in HTML to creatively express who I am. Each
      image, video, and audio clip represents a piece of my journey, my
      interests, and my dreams. From responsive images that adapt across
      devices, to an audio message and an embedded video, this page is a
      reflection of my story in a uniquely digital form. Thank you for taking
      the time to explore my work.
