 <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        I am a passionate and resilient learner with a background in HR and entrepreneurship. Over the past few years, 
        I have developed a keen interest in technology and how it can be used to build scalable systems that solve real-life problems. 
        This interest sparked my decision to transition into tech, particularly software engineering.
